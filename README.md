# WorkDayScheduler

Daily calendar with activities:

Description:

I have created an application that allows the user to plan a daily schedule from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. . The user can add multiple events to each hour and all events get saved and in local storage.  If the user refreshes the page all events are saved in local console and the user can still access their schedule.  The application will help users gain better understanding of some front-end definitions.  This application helped me as a developer understand javascript better. 

Installation:

The site can be accessed through 

Usage:

Can be used daily to keep hourly schedule
